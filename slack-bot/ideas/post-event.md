Hi everyone,
**Now**
- If you want to keep the playbooks you've made, you should back them up. (rsync, scp, etc, ask us (soon!) if you need help.)
- Are you done? Just give this message a :checkered_flag:.
**Wednesday**
- We need to take down the APO and Amer region VMs :earth_americas::earth_asia: by their local evenings.
- Are you still working? let us know, we will try and shuffle you around, but no promises it's possible :disappointed:
**Friday**
- :put_litter_in_its_place: The rest of the VMs will be deleted.

**The Future**

- Join the Galaxy admin community! There's a bunch of people doing the same thing as you all gitter.im/galaxyproject/admins
- Stay in touch on twitter: :bird: @galaxyproject @gxytraining

A huge thank you to all who participated, and may you have happy travels across the Galaxy!
