**Good Morning Everyone!** :earth_asia::earth_africa::earth_americas:
Welcome to last day of admin training!

**Today**
This is the final day of all the teachers being here all of the time, so ask your questions! It is up to you to ask for help, we don't know if you've fallen behind or are struggling with an issue so let us know, don't be afraid to ask!
If you want to keep the playbooks you've made, you should back them up. (rsync, scp, etc, ask us if you need help.)

**Tomorrow**
The instructors will be taking some much needed rest :sleeping:

**The next few days**
We'll be sending you a survey.  We need your feedback. Was this week useful to you? Say thank you by filling it out. :pray: :wave:
VMs will stay online for a few days, we'll do our best to keep them as available as possible.
Instructors might be around, but, less so than before.
We will start directing questions to gitter (see below)

**The Future**
Did you not have time to do everything you wanted to? There's a rumour parts of this event might happen again during GCC during the summer. :shushing_face:
Join the Galaxy admin community! There's a bunch of people doing the same thing as you all gitter.im/galaxyproject/admins
