        In this tutorial, we will provide a walkthrough on how to generate a customized protein
        sequence database using RNA-Seq data.  The resultant FASTA database contains sequences
        with single amino acid variants (SAVs), insertions and deletions (indels)and transcript
        assemblies (splicing variants). This database can then be used to identify protein sequence
        variants from the mass spectrometry data.

        mass spectrometry data against a custom proteogenomics FASTA database to create peptide
        spectral matches (PSMs) for each dataset; we also isolate non-canonical peptides from the
        resulting data for further analysis.

        In this tutorial, the basic workflow for metaproteomics is described, which includes database search,
        seeking taxonomy information and functional analysis. Related metaproteomics and functional microbiome
        tools and GTN tutorials are also mentioned in this tutorial.
